We came late last night. I was bound to telle them the news. I was
here but once. It would be very nice to take a walk down to the lake. What
had we to do with it? What time is it? The room is too small.

The wood on the isle was dear, but I bought it. I found the wine to 
be too sour. I would do it on the spot. Give the monk the book. The wheat
is ripe. I hear the noise. Give us our eight pence back. We use the same
knife. The oil was very bad. The swans are near the hedge. The duke was 
sick last week. It rains. Quite near the house is a very big oak. To be wrong.
The Far East. We met them near the hut. To add. Our task is done. The rest
is with him. What had we to do?

We live above them. Her dwelling seems to be very dark. Come 
along with us. What was the matter with the officer? His son is a very polite
young man. I was just six years old. I am to do it. I would fight him. Yes, we
can read German. He had very often spoken to us about it. I am bad, but he
is worse. Who is it? All is well. How did he dare to come! Too late! He could
arrange to live with us during the last four weeks. I find the film very good.
We have seen them pass.

Who can tell! It would be better to leave them alone. It was about time
we did it. Six years hence. The Japanese Empire is very populous. Could we
but get rare foreign stamps! I am an hour late. We all did it with one accord.
The boys are waiting near the school. When it rains we take a carriage. The
firs on the island are very old. The whole affair seems very queer to us. I 
have put more oil on the swollen foot. Our neighbour, the young minister, is
ill. What number was it? I suppose the foreigner is an American banker. The 
gardener had bought five spades. How warm it was last night! What is he 
but an usurper? Let him do it. He speaks too loud.

We shall have it wet. If I could but see him. What of that? This 
house is to be let. An accident. He was very good to them. Would to heaven!
How are they? Has he had his money? Not at all. To which boy shall I give
these pens? Now and then. The lady looked up with a smile. And so on. I have
no money with me. The other day. Who has done it? You shall do it. I can 
no longer stay with you. Fifty years or so. I should like her. Better a word
in time that two afterwards. Off and on. That is too long a story. Have some tea.

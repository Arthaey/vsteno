14. August 2018: New rule formalism

Either:    A => B
Or:        A => array(a, b, c, d ...)
where:     a is the original B (i.e. replacement for REGEX)
           b, c, d ... are exceptions: if one of the matches, the rule won't be applied
           
           can be used for example for word "gesch채ft": 
           define a rule which replaces "sch채ft" => "{SCHAFT}"
           define exception "gesch채ft" (rule shouldn't be applied to that word)

           in PHP:
           "schaft$ => array( "{SCHAFT}", "Gesch채ft(en?)?" )

           Advantages:
           (1) exceptions can be indicated together with rules (more logical and better to understand)
           (2) possible to use REGEX also for exceptions (big plus)
           
           Performance-whise this should also be beneficial since exceptions are only tested if first part of rule matches
           (in the old version, every exception was tested on every word).

// ok, when I implemented data.php (which evolved from php-file with data as variables included to
// and include that loaded the same variables from db via a parser) I was too lazy to implement a proper
// "import_from_database"-function ... As a result, data.php relied on session-variables to load the actual
// model. This worked fine as long as only one model was used (and the model never change). Now, with two
// models (german and spanish), this "autoloading via include" makes it impossible to switch between the
// models since whenever you include data.php the models gets loaded before you can change it. Which means:
// you cannot start the calculation (via input form) and then change the model according to what you selected
// in the input form. The fastest and easiest (= with as little work as possible) way around that for the moment
// is to "intercept" the post-variable in data.php in order to change the session-variables beforehand
// (pretending the model has already been selected before the form is evaluated).
// Of course: This is not good programming style at all ... (looks more like BASIC with spaghetti-code-gotos here
// and there ... :)

// adjust session variable so that correct model gets loaded
// session-variable is also used to set correct rules pointers for regex-parser-functions!!!

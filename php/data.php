14. August 2018: New rule formalism

Either:    A => B
Or:        A => array(a, b, c, d ...)
where:     a is the original B (i.e. replacement for REGEX)
           b, c, d ... are exceptions: if one of the matches, the rule won't be applied
           
           can be used for example for word "gesch채ft": 
           define a rule which replaces "sch채ft" => "{SCHAFT}"
           define exception "gesch채ft" (rule shouldn't be applied to that word)

           in PHP:
           "schaft$ => array( "{SCHAFT}", "Gesch채ft(en?)?" )

           Advantages:
           (1) exceptions can be indicated together with rules (more logical and better to understand)
           (2) possible to use REGEX also for exceptions (big plus)
           
           Performance-whise this should also be beneficial since exceptions are only tested if first part of rule matches
           (in the old version, every exception was tested on every word).

// main

// ok, when I implemented data.php (which evolved from php-file with data as variables included to
// and include that loaded the same variables from db via a parser) I was too lazy to implement a proper
// "import_from_database"-function ... As a result, data.php relied on session-variables to load the actual
// model. This worked fine as long as only one model was used (and the model never change). Now, with two
// models (german and spanish), this "autoloading via include" makes it impossible to switch between the
// models since whenever you include data.php the models gets loaded before you can change it. Which means:
// you cannot start the calculation (via input form) and then change the model according to what you selected
// in the input form. The fastest and easiest (= with as little work as possible) way around that for the moment
// is to "intercept" the post-variable in data.php in order to change the session-variables beforehand
// (pretending the model has already been selected before the form is evaluated).
// Of course: This is not good programming style at all ... (looks more like BASIC with spaghetti-code-gotos here
// and there ... :)

// adjust session variable so that correct model gets loaded
// session-variable is also used to set correct rules pointers for regex-parser-functions!!!
if (!(isset($_SESSION['actual_model']))) $_SESSION['actual_model'] = $default_model;
$model_to_load = $_SESSION['actual_model'];

// DO NOT ECHO DEBUG INFORMATION HERE => THATS BEFORE HTML HEAD!!!!!!!!!!
$text_to_parse = LoadModelFromDatabase($model_to_load);
//echo "text: $text_to_parse<br><br>";
// barrow a font from another model

///////////////////// prepare patching to use one and the same font for all models //////////
// idea is to "borrow a font from another model ///////////////////////////////////////////
// use the following line to test (or comment out to use traditional functionality ///////
if ($_POST['font_borrow_yesno'] === "yes")  // use POST (SESSION not yet set)
    $text_to_parse = BorrowFont( $text_to_parse, htmlspecialchars($_POST['font_borrow_model_name']));
/////////////////// end of patching //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

$_SESSION['last_updated_model'] = $actual_model;

// set statistics
//$_SESSION['statistics_tokens'] = count($steno_tokens_master[$actual_model]);
//$_SESSION['statistics_rules'] = count($rules);


/* not sure whether this is a good idea ...
// The problem with data.php is that you can't control the moment when the model is loaded.
// It is loaded automatically whenever data.php is included via require_once.
// This leads to the result that when calculate.php is invoked via input form, first the
// model is loaded (because of require_once) and only then the new form values are set.
// To solve this for the moment: Introduce a new function LoadModel() which will allow
// other program parts to (Re)Load the actual model at any moment. It is not very beautiful
// solution because it means that sometimes the same model has to be loaded twice, but
// the advantage is that it garantuees 100% backwards compatibility with code that relies
// on the immediate model loading via require_once.
function LoadModel() {
    global $actual_model;
    echo "Model reloaded<br>";
    $model_to_load = $_SESSION['actual_model'];
    $text_to_parse = LoadModelFromDatabase($model_to_load);
